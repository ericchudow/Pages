# Shabbat Morning Services

![image-left]({{ 'images/Ross in tallis with siddur 2-small.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} 
Shabbat morning services will begin at 9:30 AM at Chizuk Amuno Congregation.  Ross will be leading most of the service, so please plan to be on time.  We ask that you either leave your electronic devices at home (or in the hotel), or silence them before coming to synagogue.  Men are expected to wear a kippah (head covering), and women may wear one if they so desire.  There will be kippot for Ross’ Bar Mitzvah just outside the main sanctuary.  ![image-right]({{ 'images/Ross reading Torah-small.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-right} Any adult being honored with an Aliyah or other role on the bima will also need to wear a tallit (prayer shawl); extras are available at synagogue if you don’t bring one with you. 


Services usually last a little over two hours and will be followed by a kiddush lunch reception (kosher, meat).  Please let us know if you have any food allergies or restrictions.  At this time, Chizuk Amuno is not allowing any indoor eating due to COVID restrictions, so please be prepared with a warm coat to eat outside if this has not changed. 

For guests who are unable to join us in person, a livestream of the service for those who would like to view it will also be available at [https://www.chizukamuno.org/livestream](https://www.chizukamuno.org/livestream). 

# Saturday Night

We are not planning on having a celebratory party on Saturday night but have instead chosen to celebrate Ross’ Bar Mitzvah in Israel during winter break (COVID-willing).  Depending on COVID restrictions at the time, we may host a kosher pizza get-together at our house for seudah shlishit (Saturday evening meal).
