# Welcome to Ross Chudow’s Bar Mitzvah Website

Hello!  We’re so excited that you will be able to join us to celebrate Ross becoming a Bar Mitzvah.  We have tried to include as much information here as possible to help you navigate the weekend.  Due to COVID, certain plans won’t be finalized until we get closer to the big day, so please check back regularly for updates.
