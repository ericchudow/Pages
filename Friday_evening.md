title: "Friday Evening"
---

We are planning to have Friday evening Shabbat services and dinner for our out-of-town guests; if this includes you, you should have received something extra with your invitation.  Services will be at our synagogue, Chizuk Amuno Congregation, followed by a kosher, meat dinner.  Please let us know if you have any food allergies or restrictions. At this time, Chizuk Amuno is not allowing any indoor eating due to COVID restrictions, so please be prepared with a warm coat to eat outside if this has not changed.
