We are requesting that all Bar Mitzvah attendees who are eligible for one of the COVID vaccines be **fully vaccinated** prior to coming to celebrate with us.  There are family and community members who are ineligible or immunocompromised, and we want to make this a safe weekend for them.  If you have specific medical conditions that prohibit vaccination, please reach out to us directly.  Further, current synagogue policy is that all adults who enter the building must be fully vaccinated, and that everyone—regardless of vaccination status—must remain properly masked while indoors.
