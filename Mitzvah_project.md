For my Mitzvah Project, I have chosen to partner with the [Blue Ribbon Project](https://www.blueribbonproject.org/).  The Blue Ribbon Project is an organization that helps kids of all ages that have been victims of child abuse or neglect and are being emergently placed into the foster care system.  When these children are removed from dangerous situations, they often are not able to bring anything with them.  Imagine that—no clothes, no toys, no blankets, not even a toothbrush.  The Blue Ribbon Project [Backpacks of Love](https://www.blueribbonproject.org/our-programs/backpacks-of-love.html) program collects clothing, toiletries, blankets, toys, books, and even toothbrushes, to give these children.  They put everything a child could need into a bag, ready to go at a moment’s notice, for whenever they are notified of a child being displaced.  

This specific project is important to me because I know through my mother’s work how many children are in dangerous situations.  I can’t even imagine being taken away from my family and my home, let alone being a victim of abuse.  So, if I can collect items for these children, and for the Blue Ribbon Project, to make this transition even a little easier for those kids, then that’s what I’m going to do.

Please follow this link to my [Amazon Wish List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2DNYNVMKIC037?ref_=wl_share), so that you can help donate items to go into emergency bags.  I will be collecting items for boys my age who need to quickly go into foster care.
